# mathematics-notes

This repository is not a textbook or a collection of solved exercises.

It is an evolving map of mathematical structures, methods,
and conceptual connections built through sustained study.

The goal is not coverage, but coherence.

## Structure

- **foundations/**  
  Core mathematical areas and long-form study notes.

- **methods/**  
  Proof strategies and reusable reasoning patterns.

- **concepts/**  
  Atomic concept notes focusing on single ideas.

- **net/**  
  Cross-disciplinary links (e.g. math and AI).

- **pool/**  
  Learning process, logs, and open questions.
